anki-editor -- Emacs minor mode for making Anki cards with Org

/Since I'm not a native English speaker, feel free to correct me if
there were any ambiguity or grammatical mistakes ;-)/

* Installation

  *Requirements*
  - [[https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect#installation][anki-connect]],
    an Anki add-on required by this package to interact with Anki.
  - curl

  If you have [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] in your =package-archives=,
  just =M-x package-install RET anki-editor RET=, or install it
  manually by downloading and visiting [[./anki-editor.el][anki-editor.el]] in your
  emacs buffer, and =M-x package-install-from-buffer RET=.

* Usage

** The Layout of Notes

   Now you can compose Anki notes in Org syntax, e.g. lists, code
   examples, tables, embedded latex, when being submitted to Anki,
   they will be converted to HTML by Org-mode's HTML backend with
   specific markers (e.g. latex) translated to Anki style.

   The structure of a note is as follow, which is inspired by
   =org-drill=. More examples can be found in [[./examples.org][examples.org]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC org

   - An Anki note is an Org entry with =ANKI_NOTE_TYPE= property
   - Anki tags can be set in two ways
     1. With "ANKI_TAGS" property, multiple tags are seperated with space
     2. With Org tags [fn:1], this could be turned off if you would like to keep Org tags separated from Anki tags
   - Other necessary information (e.g. deck, note type) of a note is
     put in the property drawer of the entry
     - As the value of =ANKI_DECK= is retrieved with inheritance, you
       don't have to set it per note, instead, you could create a deck
       entry with this property set and put note entries under it, or
       set it per file by ~#+PROPERTY: ANKI_DECK YourDeck~
   - Child entries of a note entry are fields

* Limitations

** Tags between Anki and Org

   Because the set of characters allowed in tags is different between
   Anki and Org, you have to make sure that tags from Anki are
   compatible with Org and tags in Org could be recognized by Anki.

** Working with Anki add-ons

   This package may not work well when you are using certain Anki
   add-ons especially those who extend the builtin Anki note editor to
   automatically fill note field content (e.g. ~Add note id~).

* Demo

  [[./demo.gif]]


[fn:1] It should be noted that Org only allows letters, numbers, =_=
and =@= in a tag but Anki allows more, so you may have to edit you
Anki tags before they can be used in Org without any surprise.
